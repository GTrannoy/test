WF_inputs_synchronizer.vhd

Considering radiation hardness registering constant inputs on three flip flops stages is probably a weekness. Proabably only one TMR flip-flop per input would be enough.

The wishbone bus is actually properly implemented as it removes any flip-flops from the data and address bus. Notice that the traditional synchronous implementation would require to register the data and address on the IOs, preventing the use of TMR flip-flops.



I made a synthesis with XST on an Spartan6. No serious problems. It only found the following warnings:

wf.crc.vhd

c_GENERATOR_POLY_length and c_VERIFICATION_MASK should both come from a generic


wf_cons_bytes_processor.vhd
line 422. Isn't it possible to check c_CTRL_BYTE_INDEX, c_PDU_BYTE_INDEX and c_LENGTH_BYTE_INDEX upon reception? That would save 24 flip-flops.
