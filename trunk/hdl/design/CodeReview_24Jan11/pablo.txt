WF_inputs_synchronizer.vhd

Considering radiation hardness registering constant inputs on three flip flops stages is probably a weekness. Proabably only one TMR flip-flop per input would be enough.

The wishbone bus is actually properly implemented as it removes any flip-flops from the data and address bus. Notice that the traditional synchronous implementation would require to register the data and address on the IOs, preventing the use of TMR flip-flops.



I made a synthesis with XST on an Spartan6. No serious problems. It only found the following warnings: 

WARNING:HDLCompiler:92 - "E:\ohr\cern-fip\trunk\hdl\design\wf_crc.vhd" Line 184: s_q_check_mask should be on the sensitivity list of the process

wf.crc.vhd

c_GENERATOR_POLY_length and c_VERIFICATION_MASK should both come from a generic


To tom.  crc_ok_p is not registered to reduce the number of flip flops, remember this is a rad hard design. It is marcked as p because it is generated using  s_crc_bit_ready_p which is already a pulse. 


wf_cons_bytes_processor.vhd
line 422. Isn't it possible to check c_CTRL_BYTE_INDEX, c_PDU_BYTE_INDEX upon reception? That would save 16 flip-flops. 

wf_rx_tx_oscillator.vhd

Interesting note from IEC 61158-2

9.2.6 Preamble
In order to synchronize bit times a preamble shall be transmitted at the beginning of each
PhPDU consisting of the following sequence of bits, shown from left to right in order of
transmission:
1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0.
(shown as a waveform in Figure 32)
NOTE 1 Received preamble can contain as few as four bits due to loss of one bit through each of four repeaters
(as specified in the MAU Network Configuration Rules).
The period may be extended, but not reduced, by Systems management as given in Table 4.
A preamble extension sequence as listed in Table 4 shall be defined as the following
sequence of bits, shown from left to right in order of transmission:
1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0.



wf_engine_control.vhd

To Javier. Using std_logic on entity ports is a strong rule in cores. As wf_engine_control.vhd is interfaced with other custom entities this rule should become only a recomendation. Passing var as a custom type gives the possibility to the designer to chose the suitible encoding scheme easily wich is very handy for this critical signal. 

To Gonzalo. Receiving to consecutive ID_DAT would be a legal situation? I only see it happening in case an RP_DAT is lost. In that case the watchdog should have reset the control state machine.

Line 775: This process is equivalent to a case statement. The exit is needed to select the case that is driving s_var_id.
