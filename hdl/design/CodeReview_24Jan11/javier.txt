Comments on NanoFIP VHDL code from Javier Serrano

General comments
----------------

None so far. Enjoying looking at code after quite a while, sipping a
bio mango juice from Burkina Faso.

nanofip.vhd

Line 313 and 314. Synplify attributes make code less portable. Could
they be pushed out of the code into some Synplify config file? I don't
have strong feelings about this though.

wf_inputs_synchronizer.vhd
--------------------------

Line 250 onwards. Cosmetics: the vector notation is shorter, so I'd
stick to it for all cases, including the varX_access.

Line 326. I don't think it's a good idea to synchronize the data from
the user in slone mode. If there is an incoherent state (i.e. some
bits have flipped and others haven't) this state will propagate
through the pipeline. Only control signals need to be synchronized (as
is done for the wishbone). The user *must* ensure the data are stable
by the time VAR3_RDY goes to zero, so the 3*16 FFs spent here can only
get us trouble. Incidentally, I think we should change the spec so it
does not say we sample the data on the first clock tick after VAR3_RDY
goes down. We can also sample a couple of ticks later, the user should
not care. Oops, now I see these lines are also used in wishbone mode
for data_in. I am pretty sure the argument still applies. In fact we
are not synchronizing the WB address, why synchronize the data_in?

Line 347. One could argue about the need for these. We know these
inputs are static. While I can't really think how these FFs could get
us in trouble, they are certainly not needed, so why risk it?
