ERRATA
------
Table 5, MPS Status, Memory offset 10.
   Shows value 0Ah, this should be 05h

Table 6, Produced Variable MPS Status, Memory offset 11.
   Shows value 0Ah, this should be 05h

Table 6, Produced Variable MPS Status, Memory offset 10.
   Shows value 0Ah, this should be 05h

7.1 Pin assignment
   M_ID[3:0] - Table: SID1 -> S_ID1
   C_ID[3:0] - Table: SID1 -> S_ID1

Table 9: NanoFIP memory map
	Uses too many addresses. Make bit 9 always 0 (reserved) and shift bits 9-8 to 8-7.

CLARIFICATIONS
--------------
P3_LGTH[2:0] should be set to 000 when using the stand-alone mode. (Chapter 7)



ADDITIONS TO BE DONE
--------------------
Pinout of IC
Page 13: address is 1 bit too long
DATA_O and DATA_I buses that appeared as 16-bit whereas the Wishbone interface was defined as 8-bit.

The Fieldrive outputs Voh of upto 4.8V. The NanoFIP is not capable of handling that, so a level conversion is needed. Would resistors be good enough? See NanoFIP test board.

Add CYC_I input.
Add a chapter about the Wishbone interface.
