## Schedules the different frames to be sent by the Bus Arbitrer separated by stand-by times. The frame parameters must be separated by comas, without spaces.
## The order and values must be as follows: id_rp: (1) for ID_DAT frame / (0) for RP_DAT frame, station adress: 8-bit in hexadecimal format,
## variable adress: Identification(10h)/ Presence(14h)/ Broadcast(91h)/ Consumed(05h)/ Produced(06h)/ Reset (E0h), variable data length: integer from 2 to 124
231 us		-- stand-by time
1,5A,06,0	-- ID_DAT for Produced variable
2000 ms		-- final stand-by time to end the simulation
