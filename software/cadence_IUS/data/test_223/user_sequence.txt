## Sequence of Wishbone transfers separated by stand-by times. The transfer parameters must be separated by comas, without spaces.
## The order and values must be as follows: rd_wr: (0) for read / (1) for write, variable: (1) for consumed / (2) for broadcast / (3) for produced,
## data transfer size: integer from 1 to 124, transfer offset: integer from 1 to 124, transfer block size: integer from 1 to 124.
