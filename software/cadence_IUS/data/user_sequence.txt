## Sequence of Wishbone transfers separated by stand-by times. The transfer parameters must be separated by comas, without spaces.
## The order and values must be as follows: rd_wr: (0) for read / (1) for write, variable: (1) for consumed / (2) for broadcast / (3) for produced,
## data transfer size: integer from 1 to 124, transfer offset: integer from 1 to 124, transfer block size: integer from 1 to 124.
616 us	-- stand-by time
0,1,124,0,0	-- reading VAR1 from memory
447 us		-- stand-by time
0,1,124,0,0	-- reading VAR1 from memory
31 us		-- stand-by time
1,3,124,0,0	-- writting VAR3 in memory
2000 ms		-- final stand-by time to end the simulation
